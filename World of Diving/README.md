World of Diving
===============

Fixed
-----
- halos on all surfaces
- Unity Light, Shadows & Specular highlights fixed.
- Water refraction, halos, etc
- Flashlight clipping
- Sun depth no longer varies with convergence and is pinned at an appropriate
  depth.

Update 2014-11-28
-----------------
- Fixed a few more surface shaders (watch faces)
- Fixed screen on scuba-scooter moving to the right with UI depth
- Fixed distortion effect on scuba-scooter in multiplayer
- Made the shadow fix more reliable in a few situations.

Keys
----
UI Depth adjustment (except mouse cursor):

- 5: Screen depth
- 6: 25%
- 7: 50%
- 8: 75%
- 9: 90% (default)
- 0: 95%
- Tab: Hold to bring UI to screen depth (necessary to avoid problems with text
  wandering to the right on the diving computer).


Convergence Presets:

- [: Sets a low convergence (0.03) that keeps everything behind the mask
- ]: Sets a higher convergence (0.1) for a better 3D effect. Sometimes things
  are slightly in front of the mask, but it's worth it for the better 3D.

You can save your own custom convergence & separation preset to these buttons.
First, press the button you want to edit, then adjust the convergence and
separation with the standard nVidia keys (Ctrl+F5/F6 if advanced keys are
enabled in the control panel) and finally press F7 to save.

Known Issues
------------
- Like many Unity games, the mouse cursor depth cannot be adjusted as it uses a
  hardware cursor. Press 5 when in a menu to bring the UI back to screen depth.

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game with new content being developed all the time.
  Please check back for updates to the fix for any issues in future content.

- I've fixed the surface shaders for everything in the dive shop that I'm able
  to preview, but I can't preview certain things like Dive Buddies and Boats
  without first unlocking them. Due to the way Unity surface shaders work,
  there is a fairly high chance that some of these may still be broken.  
  If you have not yet bought the game, but are planning to do so as a direct
  result of this fix, consider getting in touch with me first so I can invite
  you for XP to allow me to unlock and fix some of the higher level items
  sooner.

  Feel free to add me as a friend on Steam (DarkStarSword), but please leave a
  comment on my profile page first so I don't mistake you for a spammer.
