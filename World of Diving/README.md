World of Diving
===============

Fixed
-----
- halos on almost all surfaces.
- Unity Light and Shadows fixed.
- Sun depth no longer varies with convergence and is pinned at an appropriate
  depth.

Keys
----
- Use number row to adjust UI depth (tilde: 0%, 1-9 sets 10% multiples, 0: 100%)
- Press [ to cycle between two convergence presets that put your body on the
  outside of the mask ;-)

Known Issues
------------
- Angler fish surface is broken
- Text on diving computer moves to the right when the UI depth is adjusted
- Refraction through bubbles is incorrect
- Mouse cursor depth cannot be adjusted (press tilde when in a menu to bring
  the UI to screen depth)
