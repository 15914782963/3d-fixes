World of Diving
===============

Fixed
-----
- halos on all semi-transparent effects
- Unity Light, Shadows & Specular highlights fixed.
- Water refraction, halos, etc
- Flashlight clipping

Installation
------------
1. Unpack the zip file to ...\Steam\SteamApps\World of Diving

2. Press ] after starting a new game to load the recommended convergence.

Convergence Presets
-------------------
- [: Sets a low convergence (0.03) that keeps everything behind the mask
- ]: Sets a higher convergence (0.1) for a better 3D effect. Sometimes things
  are slightly in front of the mask, but it's worth it for the better 3D.

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game with new content being developed all the time.
  Please check back for updates to the fix for any issues in future content.

- The game is likely to become unresponsive when alt+tabbing out. This is a
  general problem with Unity 5 + DirectX 11 + exclusive mode full screen, and
  not specific to this fix (other than the fact we need exclusive mode full
  screen). A workaround is to use alt+enter to switch to windowed mode first.

- This has not been tested on Windows 8.1. If you have crashes you may need to
  use Flugan's wrapper instead - refer to the forums for details.
