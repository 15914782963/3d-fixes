World of Diving
===============

Fixed
-----
- halos on all surfaces
- Unity Light, Shadows & Specular highlights fixed.
- Water refraction, halos, etc
- Flashlight clipping

Convergence Presets
-------------------
- [: Sets a low convergence (0.03) that keeps everything behind the mask
- ]: Sets a higher convergence (0.1) for a better 3D effect. Sometimes things
  are slightly in front of the mask, but it's worth it for the better 3D.

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game with new content being developed all the time.
  Please check back for updates to the fix for any issues in future content.
