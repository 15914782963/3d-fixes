// We matched the texture used for both the bloom (which doesn't need
// to be fixed) and the lens flare (which does need to be fixed).

// The bloom effects are drawn at the correct distance into the scene,
// while the lens flare is drawn very close to 0, depending on the
// angle, so we try to match the lens flare based on it's depth:
if_gt r1.w, c221.x // > 0.04
if_lt r1.w, c221.y // < 0.1
	// The lens flare depth varies wildly with convergence, so first, undo the
	// stereo correction:
	add r31.w, r1.w, -r31.y
	mul r31.w, r31.w, r31.x
	add r1.x, r1.x, -r31.w
	// Now adjust it by a fixed percentage of separation. This is an approximation
	// only due the flare geometry, so there might be a better way to achieve this:
	mul r31.w, r31.x, c220.y
	add r1.x, r1.x, r31.w
