Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
====================================

This is a placeholder README so I don't forget any installation instructions.

Installation
------------
1. Extract the contents of the zip file to the game directory

2. Change the graphics settings to use exclusive full screen

3. Press Ctrl+Alt+F11 to disable compatibility mode (advanced keys must be enabled in the control panel)

Notes
-----
Ambient Occlusion = High works out of the box. To use extra high, you must add the game to the Max Payne 3 profile.

Known Issues
------------
Blue highlight on enemies behind cover is broken around the hips and disabled. Press F3 to re-enable.
