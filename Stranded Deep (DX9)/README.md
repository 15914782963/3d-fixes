Stranded Deep
=============

Fixed
-----
- Halos
- Water refraction
- Underwater shadows
- Moved highlights on ocean floor to correct depth
- Sun shafts
- Underwater crepuscular rays
- Automatically adjust the crosshair depth
- Automatically remove the crosshair when it is faded out
- Parallax sand is now 3D
- SSAO artefacts on rocky surfaces

Installation
------------
1. Extract the zip file to the game directory

    ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Stranded Deep

2. If your Stranded Deep executable is named Stranded_Deep_x86.exe (as opposed
   to Stranded_Deep_x64.exe), replace the d3d9.dll from the fix with the one in
   the 32bit directory.

3. Select "DirectX 9.0" when launching the game from Steam (alternatively add
   -force-d3d9 to the launch options)

Keys
----
- L: Activate recommended convergence preset - use after starting a new game,
  loading an existing game or alt+tabbing. A custom convergence can be saved
  on this key by pressing L, adjusting the convergence, then pressing F7.

- F: Holding sets a convergence suitable for use with the watch, and will
  return to the L preset on release.

- V: Cycles crosshair modes between automatic, always enabled and always
  disabled (crosshair must be enabled in the settings).

- ~: Move HUD to screen depth (use for inventory + crafting menus)

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the water looks broken, try alt+tabbing out of the game and back in.

- The convergence gets reset after starting or loading a game - press L to load
  the recommended convergence preset.

Known Issues
------------
- Mouse cursor depth cannot be adjusted

- Ocean is too rough near the shoreline due to a conflict with Helix Mod.

- Ocean becomes misaligned when the camera is tilted while side strafing.

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game and the fix is likely to be broken by updates,
  so be sure to check back regularly, and report any broken effects.
