Viscera Cleanup Detail (including Santa's Rampage & Shadow Warrior)
===================================================================

Fixed
-----
- UI menus and in-game screens
- Object highlights
- Molotov Cocktails (in Santa's Rampage)
- Shadows
- Light shafts
- Decals
- Bloom (using depth buffer - press H for alternate infinity adjustment)
- Fog

Installation
------------
Extract zip file under:

    ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Viscera\Binaries\Win32

Use the 32bit version of Viscera cleanup detail.

Do not manually adjust the separation - doing so will cause object highlights
and Molotov cocktails to become misaligned! Four separation presets are
provided on the backslash key as an alternative.

Known Issues
------------
Some object highlights and Molotov cocktails are misaligned (to the right) when
3D is disabled. This appears to be a driver issue as it happens whenever 3D is
enabled in the control panel and the fix will counter this problem, but only
while 3D is enabled and using the provided separation presets.

If you instead notice this misalignment happening to the left while 3D is
enabled, please let me know.
