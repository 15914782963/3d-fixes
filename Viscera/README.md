Viscera Cleanup Detail (including Santa's Rampage & Shadow Warrior)
===================================================================

Fixed
-----
- UI menus and in-game screens
- Object highlights
- Molotov Cocktails (in Santa's Rampage)
- Shadows
- Light shafts
- Decals
- Bloom (using depth buffer - press H for alternate infinity adjustment)
- Fog

Installation
------------
Extract zip file under:

    ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Viscera\Binaries\Win32

Use the 32bit version of Viscera cleanup detail.

Do not manually adjust the separation - doing so will cause object highlights
and Molotov cocktails to become misaligned! Four separation presets are
provided on the backslash key as an alternative.

Personal Identification Device Text Depth
-----------------------------------------
Text on personal identification tags can be moved to depth by pressing X,
however this will break some displays, such as the BitterMan 500 in the office.
To fix this, move the cursor over the broken display and press X again.

Known Issues
------------
- Some object highlights and Molotov cocktails are misaligned (to the right)
  when 3D is disabled. This appears to be a driver issue as it happens whenever
  3D is enabled in the control panel and the fix will counter this problem, but
  only while 3D is enabled and using the provided separation presets.

- If the object highlights are still misaligned with the backslash presets, try
  pressing ] to disable the correction. If neither way works, let me know.

- Some of the default nvidia key bindings affect this game, e.g. adjusting
  separation with Ctrl+F4 will freeze the physics (press F4 a second time to
  fix)
