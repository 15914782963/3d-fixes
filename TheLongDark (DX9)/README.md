- Removed interior volumetric light shafts

Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file to ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\TheLongDark\

2. Launch the game via the tld_dx9.bat in the game directory (alternatively add
   -force-d3d9 to the launch options in Steam: right click -> properties -> set
   launch options)

3. Press backslash after starting a new game, loading a new area or whenever
   the convergence resets.

- V: Toggle crosshair between automatic depth and disabled (HUD must be enabled
  in settings)

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game and the fix is likely to be broken by updates,
  so be sure to check back regularly, and report any broken effects.
