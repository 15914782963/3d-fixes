Legends of Aethereus
====================

Fixed
-----
- Lights and Shadows
- Halos on all surfaces
- Skybox
- Character portrait halos
- Crosshair depth presets added (press Q to cycle presets)

Known Issues
------------
- Spot light from lantern clips incorrectly at the side (not due to scissor
  clipping, but appears similar)
- Enemy health bars are at screen depth

Notes
-----
I haven't played very far into the game yet, so there may still be broken
effects further in. If you find something broken send me a save file.

Troubleshooting
---------------
