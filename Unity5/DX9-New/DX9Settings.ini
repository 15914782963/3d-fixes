; UseRenderedShaders=true is nearly always useful, because it trims the
; list of shaders seen while hunting down to just those active in the
; current scene.  Disable this only if you get crashes during hunting.

; DumpAll will generate ASM text files for every shader seen by the game.
; This is usually worth doing once, but not useful for every run.
DumpAll=true

; Less crashes when reloading shaders:
OverrideMethod = 2

; Unity games recently started using borderless window mode, so use a profile
; that supports 3D in a window. "3D-Hub Player" is pretty minimal:
GameProfile = fxdplayer

; Constant registers that will arrive in Vertex and Pixel Shaders, as c200.
DefVSConst1 = 200

; Mouse tends to stop working in Unity games (related to borderless window?):
InitMouse = false

; Force square surfaces (shadow maps) to be mono:
DefSquareSurfaceMode = 2

; Allow access to the view size in pixel shaders to calculate the pixel
; position on screen. This isn't usually necessary in the generic lighting fix,
; but sometimes a situation arises where it is necessary.
DefPSViewSizeConst = 210

; Fixes clipping at the edge of spot & point lights - common in Unity games.
