Do not enable stereo compute shaders - no known advantage so far, and desyncs kelp physics between eyes (haven't checked if SLI contributes).

Press \ to activate the recommended convergence preset.


SLI Notes
=========
SLI + 3D Vision is broken in this game in recent drivers. The surface of the
water is badly corrupted and plants at the surface are desynchronised between
both eyes. Either disable SLI through the control panel, or downgrade to a
known working driver:

- 372.90 (Wed Sep 21, 2016): Works
- 373.06 (Thu Oct 06, 2016): Works
- 375.63 (Sun Oct 23, 2016): Broken
- 375.70 (Fri Oct 28, 2016): Untested, presumed broken
- 375.95 (Fri Nov 18, 2016): Broken
- 376.09 (Mon Nov 28, 2016): Broken
- 376.19 (Mon Dec 05, 2016): Untested, presumed broken
- 376.33 (Wed Dec 14, 2016): Broken
- 376.48 (Wed Dec 21, 2016): Broken

Known Issues
============
While I was playing I came across a surface that was shiny and flickering like
crazy - I believe that the shader had been replaced by an unrelated one. This
was a glitch and cleared up after a restart.
