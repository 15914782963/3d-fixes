World of Diving (DX9)
=====================

Fixed
-----
- halos on all surfaces
- Unity Lights & Shadows
- Water refraction, halos, etc
- Flashlight clipping
- Unity reflections (specular highlights, environmental reflections, etc)
- Depth of glow around lights / air tanks

Installation
------------
1. Unpack the zip file to ...\Steam\SteamApps\World of Diving

2. Add -force-d3d9 to the launch options in Steam (right click on the game ->
   properties -> set launch options)

3. Press ] after starting a new game to load the recommended convergence.

Convergence Presets
-------------------
- [: Sets a low convergence (0.03) that keeps everything behind the mask
- ]: Sets a higher convergence (0.1) for a better 3D effect. Sometimes things
  are slightly in front of the mask, but it's worth it for the better 3D.

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game with new content being developed all the time.
  Please check back for updates to the fix for any issues in future content.
