Gal\*Gun: Double Peace
======================
NOTE: This is a quick fix for shadows - the crosshair and UI are still 2D.

Installation
------------
Extract the zip file under:

    ....\GalGun Double Peace\Binaries\Win64

Open GalGun Double Peace\Engine\Config\BaseEngine.ini and search for:

Change it to True:

    AllowNvidiaStereo3d=True

The PSscript.lua script from Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z was used to fix the shadows in this game.
