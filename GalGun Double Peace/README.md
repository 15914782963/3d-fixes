Gal\*Gun: Double Peace
======================

Fixes
-----
- Shadows
- God Rays

NOTE: This is a quick fix only - the crosshair and UI are still 2D.

Important Note for UI adjustment
--------------------------------
Every time you run the game, move the mouse cursor as far as possible to each
side of the screen to ensure that the auto UI adjustment will work correctly.

Installation
------------
Extract the zip file under:

    ....\GalGun Double Peace\Binaries\Win64

Open GalGun Double Peace\Engine\Config\BaseEngine.ini and search for:

    AllowNvidiaStereo3d=False

Change it to True:

    AllowNvidiaStereo3d=True
