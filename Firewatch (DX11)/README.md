Update 2016-11-07

The fix has been entirely redone from scratch for the Unity 5.4 update of this
game. **Be sure to use the uninstall.bat to remove the old version of the fix
before installing this one.**

- The UI will now automatically return to screen depth whenever the mouse
  cursor is visible to make menu navigation easier.

- Fog (and certain related shadows) are now accurately fixed.
