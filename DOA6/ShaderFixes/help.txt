Dead or Alive 6 3D Vision fix by DarkStarSword

- F7: Switch to exclusive full screen mode to engage 3D Vision
- Xbox controller back button: Take 3D screenshot (3D Vision must be enabled, and this will be saved in the Documents\NVStereoscopic3D.IMG folder like those saved with Alt+F1)

Occasionally 3D may stop working when returning to the main menu - restart the game if this happens.

The giant screens in the Colosseum and Muscle stages are forced to mono. If you would prefer these to be 3D screens (but note that they will render beyond infinity) set $mono_in_game_screens=0 in the d3dx.ini.
