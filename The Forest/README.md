The Forest
==========

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. Extract the zip file to the game directory
2. Turn off motion blur (the game doesn't currently save settings, so you have
   to do this every time)

Fixed
-----
- Halos on all surfaces
- Light, shadows and specular highlights
- Pedometer screen alignment

Convergence Presets
-------------------
Two convergence presets are provided on [ and ] for convenience. The preset on
] will be selected automatically when the game is started. To save your own
presets, first, press the button you want to edit, then adjust the convergence
and separation with the standard nVidia keys (Ctrl+F5/F6 is advanced keys are
enabled in the control panel) and finally press F7 to save.

Known Issues
------------
There's only a few minor issues I haven't tracked down yet, but uplay's verify
files finally repaired my Far Cry 4 installation, so I'll come back to these
later after I've played that game.

- Glow & sun shafts around the sun & moon is at wrong depth
- Some HUD icons are at screen depth
- Ambient occlusion makes some surfaces appear to shadowed slightly differently
  in each eye. I'd still suggest leaving it on, because it adds a lot of visual
  fidelity to the game.
- Mouse cursor is at screen depth

Notes
-----
This is an early access game with regular updates, and as such the fix may get
broken by an update. Please let me know if you see any issues after an update.
