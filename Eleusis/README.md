Eleusis
=======

Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file under:

    ...\Eleusis\Binaries\Win32

2. Disable ambient occlusion in the game settings (this is broken in 2D, and I
   haven't made any attempt to fix it in 3D). You may need to restart the game
   or toggle 3D off and on if rendering is broken after changing this setting.
