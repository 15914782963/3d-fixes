; Copy the MVP and inverted MV matrices to all lighting shaders to allow us to
; calculate the projection matrix and find the horizontal FOV. This technique
; was first used to fix Dreamfall Chapters - take a look at the forum thread
; for that game and it's fix for more details on how this works.


; The projection matrix will be calculated from the matrices passed into the
; lighting shader whenever possible. This is not possible for directional
; lighting or other times it is drawing a full-screen quad, so we must also
; find other shaders to get the MV+MVP matrices from in that case. The below
; shader is a pretty common one in Unity games that we can use, but you may
; need to find others (avoid UI and depth shaders that often do not have a
; valid projection matrix). My extract_unity_headers.py script is useful to
; find other shaders that can be used here.
