Installation
------------
1. Extract zip to the game directory
2. Run HeliXmodLauncher.exe and leave it open
3. Run the game

Convergence Presets
-------------------
Four convergence presets are provided on the numbers 1-4 for convienience. 1 is
the lowest setting for the main menu, and 2-4 are higher settings for gameplay.

You can save your own custom convergence settings on 2-4, by activating the
preset, adjusting the convergence with Ctrl+F4/F5 then saving with F7.

Known Issues
------------
There is no automatic convergence preset for the main menu, as everything I
could match on that menu also triggered in-game. You can manually activate
preset 1 or 2 when in the menu instead.
