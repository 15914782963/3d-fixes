- Volumetric light shaft one-eyed halo
- Volumetric light shafts wanders off in one eye from a distance (related to coord.shader fix)
- Shadows through window in cutscene after prison section are completely broken

  SHADOW_DIRECTIONAL SHADOW_SCREEN - I think this is the first screen shadow in
  the game so far.
- Reflection in the floorboards of the councillor's office.

- Play through chapter 3 & beyond
