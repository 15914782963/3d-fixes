- Slight halo in intro cinematic (possibly related to light fix?)
- Volumetric light shaft one-eyed halo
- Volumetric light shafts wanders off in one eye from a distance (related to coord.shader fix)
- Shadows through window in cutscene after prison section are completely broken
  (other lights in the same scene work). Seems to be SHADOW_DIRECTIONAL
  SHADOW_SCREEN - I think this is the first screen shadow in the game so far.

- Play through chapter 2 & beyond
