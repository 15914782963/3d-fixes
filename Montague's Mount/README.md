Montague's Mount
================

This is a quick n' dirty fix to disable the broken shadows in this game.

It also allows the HUD depth to be customised with the keys on the number row,
and tilde to return to screen depth.

**IMPORTANT: Use nVidia Inspector to assign this game to the Aion profile. This
is necessary to allow 3D to enage since the game runs in a full-screen window
and has the additional benefit of fixing 90% of the haloing issues**

If you get flickering on some surfaces like the grass, try restarting the game.
