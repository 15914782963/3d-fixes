The Last Tinker: City of Colors
===============================

Fixed
-----
- Halos
- Shadows (new technique!)
- UI depth adjustable with 1-9 on number row, tilde for screen depth, 0 for
  99.5% depth. 8 (80%) is the default.

Known Issues
------------
- Mouse cursor depth cannot be adjusted
- Fog is slightly off (looks a bit weird even in 2D)
