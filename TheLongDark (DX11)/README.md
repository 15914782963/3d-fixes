The Long Dark (DX11)
====================

Update 2016-05-01
-----------------
The entire fix has been redone from scratch after an engine update to Unity 5.3
completely broke the previous version of the fix along with my unity scripts
due to major changes to the shader file format in Unity.

This version also updates the fix to use DirectX11 - **if you have used a
previous version of the fix, you will need to remove the -force-d3d9 launch
option from Steam before installing this one**.

Fixed
-----
- Shadows
- Halos
- Automatic crosshair depth added
- Footprints

Installation
------------
1. If you have used a previous version of this fix, remove the launch option in
   Steam if you used it (right click -> properties -> set launch options) and
   remove the previous fix.

2. Extract zip file to ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\TheLongDark\

3. Press backslash after starting a new game, loading a new area or whenever
   the convergence resets.

Keys
----
- Backslash: Load recommended convergence preset

Known Issues
------------
- Mouse cursor depth cannot be adjusted

Notes
-----
- This is an early access game and the fix is likely to be broken by updates,
  so be sure to check back regularly, and report any broken effects.
