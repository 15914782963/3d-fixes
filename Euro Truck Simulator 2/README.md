Euro Truck Simulator 2
======================

Fixed
-----
- Sky box, sun, moon, clouds, etc. moved to infinity
- God rays
- Square mirrors stereoised (rectangular mirrors were already 3D)
- Bad masking on water reflections fixed

Known Issues
------------
- Convergence is locked :-(
- After visiting a Truck shop, the mouse cursor may be stuck at the wrong
  depth. Restarting the game is the only reliably workaround I've found.

Installation
------------
Extract zip file to ...Steam\SteamApps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\

Notes
-----
Some of the fixes were a little tricky to separate out from other effects. If
you spot something at infinity that shouldn't be (such as headlights), or
something that should be at infinity that isn't (like the sun or clouds) please
let me know.
