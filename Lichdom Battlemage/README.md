Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file to game directory. If done correctly there should be a
   d3d11.dll in both the Bin32 and Bin64 directories.

2. Launch the game. If 3D does not engage, press alt+enter to change full
   screen modes

3. Press backslash to load the recommended convergence preset, and adjust as
   desired.

Damage indicators
-----------------
Press x to move the UI in the top half of the screen to depth to make damage
indicators comfortable to see. This will break the menus, so press x again to
return the UI to screen depth.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the 3D does not engage, try pressing alt+enter. If that doesn't work,
  change the screen mode to windowed then back to full screen.

- If you notice the UI adjustment only partially works (i.e. text pushed back,
  but the background remains at screen depth), change the resolution and then
  change it back.

- Some Windows 8.1 users may have to use the 32bit version of the game.

- If your framerate is abnormally low, try changing the resolution and then
  changing it back.

- If you find a broken effect please let me know where to find it. Be sure to
  mention what graphics settings you are using (especially water and "visual
  quality"). For reference, I have most settings set to either High or Very
  High.
