Lichdom: Battlemage
===================

Fixed
-----
- Forced nVidia 3D Vision Automatic mode (seems to only work on 32bit executable - nvapi64.dll not being hooked?)
- Halos on hands, clouds, foliage

Effects Disabled
----------------
- Shadows
- Noise sampler on snow

Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file to game directory. If done correctly there should be a
   d3d11.dll in both the Bin32 and Bin64 directories.

2. Launch the game. If 3D does not engage, press alt+enter to change full screen modes
