Lichdom: Battlemage
===================

Fixed
-----
- CryEngine Shadows!!!
- Forced nVidia 3D Vision Automatic mode
- Halos on hands, clouds, foliage

Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file to game directory. If done correctly there should be a
   d3d11.dll in both the Bin32 and Bin64 directories.

2. Launch the game. If 3D does not engage, press alt+enter to change full screen modes

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the 3D does not engage, try pressing alt+enter. If that doesn't work,
  change the screen mode to windowed then back to full screen.

- If you get a pulsating effect on transparent objects, set a different screen
  resolution then set it back to your preferred resolution.
