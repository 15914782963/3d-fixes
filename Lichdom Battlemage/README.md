Lichdom: Battlemage
===================

Fixed
-----
- First ever CryEngine Shadow fix!!!
- Forced nVidia 3D Vision Automatic mode
- Unlocked separation
- "Pulsating" translucent effects
- Disappearing / flickering objects
- Specular highlights
- Environmental reflections
- Decals
- Light shafts
- Skybox (starfield, moon, moon glow)
- Water & reflections
- Halos on most surfaces

Installation
------------
1. Extract zip file to game directory. If done correctly there should be a
   d3d11.dll in both the Bin32 and Bin64 directories.

2. Launch the game. If 3D does not engage, press alt+enter to change full
   screen modes

3. Press backslash to load the recommended convergence preset

Damage indicators
-----------------
Press x to move the UI in the top half of the screen to depth to make damage
indicators comfortable to see. This will break the menus, so press x again to
return the UI to screen depth.

Known Issues
------------
- Driver bugs can cause numerous rendering issues after playing for a while. If
  you see a stuck image, moving shadows, one eye brighter than the other or the
  whole screen blanking out it's a sign you should probably save and restart
  the game soon.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the 3D does not engage, try pressing alt+enter. If that doesn't work,
  change the screen mode to windowed then back to full screen.

- If you notice the UI adjustment only partially works (i.e. text pushed back,
  but the background remains at screen depth, which can sometimes happen after
  using windowed mode) or the framerate is abnormally low, change the
  resolution and then change it back.
