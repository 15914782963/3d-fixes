Instructions:

1. Extract the zip file to the game directory

2. Launch Steam

3. Browse to the Steam directory and delete GameOverlayRenderer.dll.

   This will temporarily disable the Steam overlay until the next time Steam is
   launched (at which time Steam will automatically restore this file), but is
   necessary to prevent a crash due to a conflict between Helix Mod and Steam
   for this game.

   If you are able to launch the game without this step you can skip it.

4. Launch the game through Steam
