Installation
------------
Unpack the zip file under:

    ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Life Is Strange\Binaries\Win32

Subtitle Depth Adjustment
-------------------------
I recommend disabling the subtitles in the settings, but if you prefer to play
with them enabled you may adjust their depth with the keys on the number row.
This adjusts the subtitles and menus, but can cause in-world HUD elements to
flicker momentarily when at a certain distance from the camera, so it is
disabled by default. tilde sets screen depth, 0 sets 99.5% and 1-9 sets
anywhere between. Press minus on the number row to disable the adjustment and
return to the game's default depth.

Notes
-----
- This is an episodic game and will likely need to be updated for future
  episodes, so check back for updates after the release of each episode.

- I played on high quality and have not checked for issues on lower settings.
