Team Sonic Racing 3D Vision fix by DarkStarSword

---- HUD ----
The HUD will automatically adjust itself while holding down the accelerator key during a match (left shift or right trigger).
If you use a non-standard accelerator button change the binding under [KeyAccelerateController] in the d3dx.ini.
You can also tweak the HUD depth under [Constants] and the timings under the above key binding.

---- Ambient Occlusion Bug Fix ----
This fix corrects a game bug which could cause shadow artefacts, however this fix changes the tone of some of the graphics.
If you would prefer to play with the vanilla tone and accept the artefacts, Ctrl+Shift+Alt+B will toggle the AO BUG fix on and off.

---- Mouse Cursor ----
This fix hides the mouse cursor, on the assumption that you are playing with a controller. If you prefer to use the mouse to
navigate the menus change hide_cursor to 0 in the d3dx.ini.

---- Game Settings ----
Although I have fixed issues on low quality settings and it should work, I've mostly been playing on high quality settings,
so if you see any stereo issues try setting the quality to high first.

---- Screenshots ----
The controller back button will take a 3D screenshot that can be found in the usual Documents\NVStereoscopic3D.IMG place.
